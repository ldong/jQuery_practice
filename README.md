## Learning jQuery

It seems like the most easy way to crack the way out of javascript.

This repo is the practice I followed by [30 days to learn jquery](https://tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-jquery/). And I also suggest newbie to start from javascript, EmberJS, then jQuery.


Step 1: [JavaScript of Gitbook](http://gitbookio.github.io/javascript/conditional/README.html).

Step 2: EmberJS

Step 3: Bootstrap (majorly its CSS)
